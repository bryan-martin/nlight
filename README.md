##The Technical Problem

###Write a program to evaluate arithmetic expressions.  Input will be text expression strings.  Here are some examples:
- 5 + 14
- (8 + 2) * 4
- 7 + 3 + 9
- (6 + 5) * (8 + 2)

###Your solution should:
- Demonstrate the ability to parse/evaluate arithmetic expressions
- Support addition and multiplication and be easily extensible to add other operations later
- Be designed and implemented in an object-oriented manner
- Not use the "Shunting Yard" algorithm
- Contain a testing framework to validate that the solution is functioning as desired
- Use whatever tools and languages you are most comfortable with
